# ScreenshotApp-Service

This repo contains the code for our webapp that will allow users to view images and make comments.
Images can be uploaded to the backend server from the Hololens, and then interacted with on the frontend.
Currently our frontend is undergoing maintenance and is not live on a production server, but the backend
is up at the link below. 

Backend server is [here](https://screenshot-tool-server.herokuapp.com/)
