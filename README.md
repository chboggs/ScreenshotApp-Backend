# ScreenshotApp-Service

This repo contains the code for our webapp that will allow users to view images.
Images can be uploaded to the backend server from the Hololens, and then viewed on the frontend.
Currently our frontend is undergoing maintenance and is not live on a production server.

Backend server is [here](https://screenshot-tool-server.herokuapp.com/)
